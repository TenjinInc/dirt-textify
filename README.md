# Dirt::Textify

Textify transforms HTML into plaintext while preserving as much legibility and functionality as possible. It's prime use is in quickly producing an automatic plaintext version of HTML emails. 

Why offer plaintext? 

 * Spam filters prefer included plain text alternative 
 * Some email clients and apps canâ€™t handle HTML
 * Some people explicitly choose plaintext, either for visual impairment or simple preference

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dirt-textify'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it manually with:

    $ gem install dirt-textify

## Usage

Just call `Dirt::Textify.textify` and pass in the html you want distilled:

```ruby
html = '<html><body>This is some markup <a href="tenjin.ca">and a link</a><p>Other tags translate, too</p></body></html>'

Dirt::Textify.textify(html)

=> "This is some markup and a link (tenjin.ca)\nOther tags translate, too\n\n" 
```
