# Dirt::Textify

Textify transforms HTML into plaintext while preserving as much legibility and functionality as possible. It's prime use is in quickly producing an automatic plaintext version of HTML emails. 

Why offer plaintext? 

 * Spam filters prefer included plain text alternative 
 * Some email clients and apps canâ€™t handle HTML
 * Some people explicitly choose plaintext, either by requirement or simple preference

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dirt-textify'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it manually with:

    $ gem install dirt-textify

## Usage

Just call `Dirt::Textify.textify` and pass in the html you want distilled:

```ruby
html = '<html><body>This is some markup <a href="tenjin.ca">and a link</a><p>Other tags translate, too</p></body></html>'

Dirt::Textify::Decoder.new(html).textify

=> "This is some markup and a link (tenjin.ca)\nOther tags translate, too\n\n"
 
```

Textify will use a <base> tag if included in the HTML source, or you can provide one explicitly: 

```ruby
html = '<html><body>Relative links <a href="/contact">Link</a></body></html>'

Dirt::Textify::Decoder.new(html).textify(link_base: 'tenjin.ca')

=> "Relative links Link (tenjin.ca/contact)"

```

### Mail Gem Example

To use Textify with the [mail](https://github.com/mikel/mail) gem, just provide the text-part by pasisng the html through Textify: 

```ruby
require 'mail'

html = 'My email and a <a href="http://tenjin.ca">link</a>'

mail = Mail.deliver do
  to      'bob@example.com'
  from    'dot@example.com'
  subject 'Using Textify with mail'

  text_part do
    body Dirt::Textify::Decoder.new(html).textify
  end

  html_part do
    content_type 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
    body html
  end
end

```
