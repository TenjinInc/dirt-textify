# Ghostwriter

Ghostwriter rewrites your emails to conform to varying email client requirements. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ghostwriter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it manually with:

    $ gem install ghostwriter

## Usage

###Stripping HTML

Transform HTML into plaintext while preserving as much legibility and functionality as possible. 
It's prime use is in quickly producing an automatic plaintext version of HTML emails. 

Why offer plaintext? 

 * Spam filters prefer included plain text alternative 
 * Some email clients and apps canâ€™t handle HTML
 * Some people explicitly choose plaintext, either by requirement or simple preference

Create a `Ghostwriter::Writer` with the html you want modified, and call `#textify`:

```ruby
html = '<html><body>This is some markup <a href="tenjin.ca">and a link</a><p>Other tags translate, too</p></body></html>'

Ghostwriter::Writer.new(html).textify

=> "This is some markup and a link (tenjin.ca)\nOther tags translate, too\n\n"
 
```

`#textify` will use a `<base>` tag if included in the HTML source, or if one is provided explicitly: 

```ruby
html = '<html><body>Relative links <a href="/contact">Link</a></body></html>'

Ghostwriter::Writer.new(html).textify(link_base: 'tenjin.ca')

=> "Relative links Link (tenjin.ca/contact)"

```

#### Mail Gem Example

To use `#textify` with the [mail](https://github.com/mikel/mail) gem, just provide the text-part by pasisng the html through Ghostwriter: 

```ruby
require 'mail'

html = 'My email and a <a href="http://tenjin.ca">link</a>'

mail = Mail.deliver do
  to      'bob@example.com'
  from    'dot@example.com'
  subject 'Using Ghostwriter with Mail'

  html_part do
      content_type 'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
      body html
    end
  
  text_part do
    body Ghostwriter::Writer.new(html).textify
  end
end

```
